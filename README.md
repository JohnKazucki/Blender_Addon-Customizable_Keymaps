# Blender_Addon-Customizable_Keymaps
 A minimal example on how to have customizable keymaps in the preferences of your Blender addon


## Why this Folder Structure?
I recommend following this folder/file structure for any addon, no matter how small.
This makes expanding the addon or merging functionality together much easier.
